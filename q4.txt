I am searching for pop ebp, pop esp, and add esp, 4 gadgets using GadgetSearch.find() because these gadgets are necessary for manipulating the base pointer and stack pointer.
 after I found the gadgets I am  constructing the payload with 131 bytes of padding, followed by the addresses and gadgets in the required order to control the execution flow and achieve the desired outcome.
The payload, constructed to move 1 to auth, override it, and return to the original function, resulting in Victory!, is returned as a bytes object for use in the sudo program.
